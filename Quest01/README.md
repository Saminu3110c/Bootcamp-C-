# Welcome to Quest01
## Task
The Task is to get familiar with the basic C syntax (variable, if, while-loop, functions and ASCII)

## Description
I solved it by applying my little knowledge on C programming. And beside that, I googled some things online that I found helpful in completing the exercises.

## Installation
I did not install it. And it does not need Installation just learning the basic of C Language.

## Usage
I works the way it's designed to and it's really amazing!
