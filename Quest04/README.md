# Welcome to Quest04
## Task
The last exercise (ex05) was to create a function that takes in a flight path of a rocket ship as a string of letters and returns the following format: "{x: X, y: Y, direction: 'DIRECTION'}"

## Description
I solved it by searching many c syntaxes online to convert the code that I already wrote in my preseason web and engaged with my friend for some guides.

## Installation
Int does not need any Installation. It's just codes to be familiar with and learn c programming concept.

## Usage
It works correctly the way it was designed to. And it's really good.
